# Discriminator for GAN Models

This Discriminator module is an essential component for GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) models, aimed at distinguishing real images from those generated by a generator. It's designed to work with images of various sizes and can classify images into multiple categories. Below is the comprehensive guide on how to set up, use, and integrate this module into your machine learning projects.

## Features

- **Flexible Input**: Supports both grayscale and RGB images through adjustable input channels.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Capable of classifying images into several predefined classes besides performing the real vs. generated discrimination.
- **Configurable Architecture**: Allows customization of the neural network layers to suit different complexities and requirements of datasets.
- **Efficient Training**: Implements LeakyReLU activation and optional batch normalization for stable and efficient training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch (torch, torchvision)

Ensure these are installed in your Python environment to utilize the Discriminator module effectively.

## Setup

Logging is configured to record the model's operations, including the initialization and forward passes, which are saved in `./logs/discriminator.log`. The module utilizes `utils.py` for auxiliary functions like calculating the total number of parameters in the model.

## Parameters and Attributes

### Constructor Parameters

| Parameter     | Type | Description                                                    | Default |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `in_channels` | int  | The number of input channels (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB).     | 1       |
| `num_labels`  | int  | The number of classes for the output classification layer.     | 4       |
| `image_size`  | int  | Base size of the convolutional filters, affecting model depth. | 64      |

### Methods

- **`connected_layer`**: Dynamically constructs the network layers based on configuration.
- **`forward`**: Performs a forward pass on input data, returning a tuple of real/fake output and class label logits.

## Usage

The module can be executed as a standalone script or imported into other projects. Command-line arguments allow for easy customization of the model's parameters.

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument        | Description                                     | Default |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--in_channels` | Define whether the images are RGB or grayscale. | 1       |
| `--image_size`  | Define the size of the images.                  | 64      |
| `--num_labels`  | Define the number of labels/classes.            | 2       |
| `--netD`        | Flag to initialize and log the Discriminator.   | False   |

### Example Command

```sh
python discriminator.py --in_channels 3 --image_size 64 --num_labels 10 --netD
```

This command initializes a Discriminator for RGB images (3 channels) with an image size of 64x64, capable of classifying images into 10 different classes.

## Output

The script initializes the Discriminator model with the specified configurations, logging the model's structure and the total number of trainable parameters to `./logs/discriminator.log`.
